These cells are also demarcated by the special start (`## ==== BEGIN EVALUATION PORTION`) and end (`## ==== END EVALUATION PORTION`) comments. Do **NOT** remove any of these comments from the designated cells, otherwise your assignment will not be evaluated correctly.\n",

Pruning a certain percentage from some component may result in a much larger performance degradation compared to pruning the same percentage from another component. Moreover, you might observe that when you prune carefully, the performance degradation from component A might be worse than that for component B. But when you prune randomly, the trend might switch. This may mean that certain components contain a higher concentration of critical heads whilst other components have their importance more evenly distributed across heads, making them more resilient to targeted pruning but potentially more vulnerable to random pruning."
